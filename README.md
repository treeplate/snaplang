# TreeSnap

A very basic version of [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html)
written in Flutter.
You can make scripts with 0-argument blocks, rename sprites, scenes, and objects, and drag scripts around.
You can download files that you can open in Snap!.
Drag a block from the top of the window to the main area, and press + to add additional blocks below it. 
If you put certain keywords in the textbox (e.g. "show", "recieveGo", "reportVariadicSum", "bounceOffEdge", "doWearNextCostume"), then when you download it (with the button in the top right) and open in Snap! it will correspond to primitives.
